## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the importance of organized HTML code and creating creating classes that can easily be located and grouped to help with the css process.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on flexbox and have a better understanding of what each element does and when best to use it.
